The last couple of years I've been slowly trying to learn Italian; from simply using duolingo to taking it more seriously with lessons and immersion. I'm particularly interested in the local dialect spoken, which a regional dialect of Neapolitan (specifically Campagnia).

Here's a list of resources I use or have made.

 - [What do you need to know to learn a foreign language?](https://www.wgtn.ac.nz/lals/resources/paul-nations-resources/paul-nations-publications/publications/documents/foreign-language_1125.pdf) - This book helped me to begin structuring my practice and "learning how to learn".
 - [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/) - It's fun keeping the streak alive and has helped me learn new vocabulary.
