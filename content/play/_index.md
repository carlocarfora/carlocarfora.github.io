Here you'll find a random assortment of content from CG related to anything hobby based, loosely organised by category 😊

#### CG

- [Houdini Notes](https://github.com/carlocarfora/houdini-notes/wiki) - Over the years I've put some of my notes into a "wiki", it's not been updated in a while as much and probably a bit outdated in places but I still find it useful to refer to when doing certain things.
- [Arnold Log Viewer](https://github.com/carlocarfora/arnold-log-viewer) - Using Streamlit I wanted to create a simple log viewer for Arnold. Designed to be simple to use and display only a subset of information that is useful for 80% - 90% of cases where you want to debug render logs.

#### Photography

- [camera.travels](https://travels.carlocarfora.co.uk/) - My photoessay website where I upload photos from travels along with some thoughts in the moment. Camera photos only, no phone shots as my personal rule and to keep me shooting with one!

#### Language

The last couple of years I've been slowly trying to learn Italian; from simply using duolingo to taking it more seriously with lessons and immersion. I'm particularly interested in the local dialect spoken, which a regional dialect of Neapolitan (specifically Campagnia).

Here's a list of resources I use or have made.

 - [What do you need to know to learn a foreign language?](https://www.wgtn.ac.nz/lals/resources/paul-nations-resources/paul-nations-publications/publications/documents/foreign-language_1125.pdf) - This book helped me to begin structuring my practice and "learning how to learn".
 - [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/) - It's fun keeping the streak alive and has helped me learn new vocabulary.
