# Carlo Carfora 

Curious about all things CG, with a focus on Lighting and Rendering. 
Currently Lighting Supervisor at [Untold Studios](https://www.untoldstudios.tv).

This is my tiny corner of the internet; you'll find my professional work here as 
well as random thoughts, musings and generally things I find interesting.
