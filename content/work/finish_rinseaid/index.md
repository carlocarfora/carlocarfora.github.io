This project I was tasked to create a digital version of the [famous water printer in Osaka](https://youtu.be/_sllYy2ng7Q?si=kxh_8PWQIB0fd0M) that could be used in the advert. Originally just setting up the FX in Houdini I ended up taking the CG from start to finish. It was a completely procedural setup that was faithful to the real life version.
