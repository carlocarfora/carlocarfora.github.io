Role: 3D / FX Artist  
Studio: The Mill  
Year: 2019  

Some highlights from my work over the past 2 years as a generalist at The Mill. Kept it short and sweet. The majority of tasks were light/render TD based with some FX work sprinkled around.

Thank you to everyone I have had the pleasure to work with on these projects and more.
