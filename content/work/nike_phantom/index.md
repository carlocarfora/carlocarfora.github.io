Role: Lighting Artist  
Studio: The Mill  
Year: 2018  

Working as a 3D/FX Artist, on this project I had a wide variety of tasks which included stadium lighting, rendering stadium/crowd/flares, close up grass and interaction smoke sims/rendering. 
I spent time optimising renders and wrote various python scripts to assist with this.
