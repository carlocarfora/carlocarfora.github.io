For this spot my role included lighting and rendering on a couple of shots, look dev and rendering of the puddle splash as well as simulation and look dev of the rabbit/leaf interactions

I was also involved in lighting and rendering the digital marketing videos which consisted of short videos that loop standalone as well as all together. They can be seen on various social media platforms.
