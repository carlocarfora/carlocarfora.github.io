Role: Director / Creator

Year: 2021  

This was my film created over 5 weeks taking part in the v4 Unreal Fellowship. It was an incredible experience and I was extremely fortunate to be a part of it. The chance to create a short film, wearing all the hats from story to director was hugely rewarding and fun with support along the way from the entire Unreal Fellowship team over at Epic.
