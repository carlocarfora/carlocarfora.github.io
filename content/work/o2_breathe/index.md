Role: FX Artist  
Studio: The Mill  
Year: 2018  

My task on this spot was for the opening "Big Bang" shot. It had to feel grand in scale and being the opening shot had to keep a viewer engaged. 
I worked closely with 2D to provide the FX renders and elements needed to achieve this in the short timeframe.
