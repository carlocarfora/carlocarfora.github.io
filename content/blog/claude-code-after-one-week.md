After just over one week of Claud Code I felt compelled to write this blog post because of how much I feel the game has changed for myself since using this.

<!-- more -->

I've been kicking the tyres of Claude Code over the past 8-9 days and I think it's already re-defined how I am approaching coding and building. In this time, I've written close to zero code personally but my GitHub has seen more code pushed to it in this time than possibly the whole of last year.

It's quite incredlible once you get yoru head into how it works and finding a way to use it, just how efficient it can be. I've found strategies that work for me, I've kept the scope of my projects small and I've managed to:

- Convert my workout tracker into a web app
- Convert my personal flight tracker into a web app
- Finish off a workout tracker I was building for fun
- Work on improving my Arnold Render Log viewer (still in progress)
- Pick up the old idea I had to rebuild my personal dashboard website
- Use Claude Code to "work" while I sleep kicking off tasks lists on the app before bed

There's been more but that list in the itme is already more productive than I could have been had I tried my absolute best. On top of this, I've learnt about some new libraries, some new ways of using GitHub and better ways to prompt and plan using Claude Code.

I'm convinced that this is going to change the way we write some software (not all of course) and it's going to introduce the rise of "personal apps"; built to serve a personal purpose and not for wide scale release. These will be for people who want more than a spreadsheet but would have had to learn web authoring skills (which in todays web landscape is not trivial).

Excited and scared is the best way to put my feelings, this feels like the writing on the wall for image generation and 3D. I don't know how long it'll take but when Claude Code for image gen/3d comes out that's when I will have to take a look at it.
