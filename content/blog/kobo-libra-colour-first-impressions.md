Having bought a Kindle many years ago, I recently felt like it was time to upgrade it. I have had one without a backlight and found it could be tiring to read
at night. The e-reader market has so many choices now!
<!-- more -->

I decided on a few features that I wanted:

- Similar small size
- Pen support 
- Good battery life

Nice to haves:

- Colour screen

After some research I settled on the [Kobo Libra Colour](https://uk.kobobooks.com/products/kobo-libra-colour/) which ticked all the boxes. Initial impressions are great, it's similar in size to my previous Kindle
and the colour screen while muted in colours is actually really nice and reminds me of newspaper print in contrast and brightness.

To use the pen support, I picked up a [Metapen 2](https://metapen.com/products/m2) as this was half the price of the official stylus while having great reviews. Writing on the screen feels a
bit more like plastic rather than paper but it is responsive and the notebook features I can see being great for learning.

All in all, pretty happy to have a replacement for my old Kindle and using the free open source software [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/) it was trivial to get books I've purchased before from Kindle > Kobo!
