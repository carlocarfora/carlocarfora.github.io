Well, 2 years later and things come full circle! Just putting the finishing touches on a website makeover and hopefully making it something a bit less sterile.

I got tired of using Squarespace as my web host, paying a yearly fee for something I barely touch just didn't sit right with me and so I turned to what I knew... Static Site Generators. 

Quickly settling on one called Zola along with a theme I liked, I was able to in only a few nights migrate my entire website over. I am amazed at how quick this process was, also customising the theme to suit my needs better. This was a manual process as Squarespace could only export a wordpress xml file that didn't play nicely with anything I tried to convert it to markdown.

Still a few things left to do to finish migrating:
- Update all the projects with videos
- Add some personal projects to the site
- Swap over to custom domain address from github address

All in all, I'm very impressed with not only Zola but also Github Actions. Having the website auto build and deploy on push just makes the entire process feel a little bit slicker!
