Might be the most blog posts in a year so far ðŸ˜„ Quite possibly 10 years after discovering this photo gallery called [Expose](https://github.com/Jack000/Expose) I have finally got it up and running. Read on if you want to know more...

For a while I've been wanting a place to put photos up. I still enjoy taking photos, maybe I don't take as much as before but there's nothing quite like exploring a new place with a camera in hand. 

I've gone to quite a few places over the years, travelled around and been very fortunate to take lots of photos. For the longest time they only lived on my local hard drives, before managing to back the majority of them up on cloud services. However it's still private, where's the fun in that?

Well, I came across [jack.ventures](http://jack.ventures/) years ago, making a mental note that one day it would be awesome to make something similar since he had graciously put his photoessay generator on github.

For now [it's just got some test images up](https://travels.carlocarfora.co.uk) while I slowly populate it with my travels over the years. It'll be a nice trip down memory lane to add photos, some stories and just take that nostalgic trip down memory lane. All the while adding current and future trips!
