Hello! I‚Äôm Carlo, and this is my tiny place on the internet üòÅ

I got tired of having a website that was simply just a front store window, and pined for the earlier internet days where websites felt like a bit more of a creative outlet and people just put themselves out there for no other reason than they could!

#### Website 

I've set this website up using [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) and an awesome theme called [anemone](https://github.com/Speyll/anemone) that allows for lots of customising but out of the box looks great. Github Pages for hosting and Github Actions for deploying, had to read the docs a few times but for the first time using it, works great!


#### Software / Hardware
I use a Macbook Pro M1 for all things professional. It's an amazing laptop and I wouldn't choose anything else given the choice to be honest now (except for a new model I guess!)

For all things personal, I have a Razer Blade Stealth 13" running my preferred OS which is Linux. I use [Pop!_OS](https://pop.system76.com), out of the box most things "just work" and together they strike a good balance between portability and usability. 

#### Things I do outside of work

- Try to learn Italian
- Writing (very slowly) a toy raytracer
- Play guitar
- Take photos
- Explore new places
- Sneak in some gaming when I can (mostly handheld these days on the Switch/Steam Deck)
- Read the odd book
- Exercise to offset all the sitting down! I do [this kettlebell workout](https://www.strongfirst.com/shop/books/simple-sinister-book/) most days and it's helped me to stay feeling physically good.
