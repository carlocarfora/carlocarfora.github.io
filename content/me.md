Hello! I‚Äôm Carlo, and this is my tiny place on the internet üòÅ

I got bored having a website that was just a portfolio and pined for the earlier internet days where websites felt like a bit more of a creative outlet.

#### Website 

I've set this website up using [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) and an awesome theme called [anemone](https://github.com/Speyll/anemone) that allows for lots of customising but out of the box looks great. Github Pages for hosting and Github Actions for deploying, had to read the docs a few times but for the first time using it, works great!

#### Things I do outside of work

- Try to learn Italian
- Writing slowly a toy raytracer
- Play guitar
- Take photos
- Explore new places
