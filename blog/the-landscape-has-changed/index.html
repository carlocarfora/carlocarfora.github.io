<h1>The Landscape Has Changed</h1>



<p>First post of the year! Won't jinx myself saying this is the first of many but let's see how it goes 😆 Professionally been getting deep into USD and personally been exploring this thing called Clude Code...</p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span>
<p>Been enjoying the challenge of working USD into our pipeline at work, been a lot to get my head around again. I have mixed feelings getting back into Solaris but it will be great to see how far it's come over the last couple of years and I'm hoping it's much smoother this time around. I'll probably post up some bits and bobs about it throughout the year, and I'd love to do more than just write on this blog about it so who knows where we might end up talking about it.</p>
<p>Now in my spare time I've been tinkering over the past few days with Claude Code. I saw so much hype about it on social media in the last few weeks I thought I better try this out. I'm comfortable in Python already, and I used to make websites while the stack was still relatively simple so I'll be honest, I wasn't expecting much. Kicking the tyres over a weekend, I was able to create a web app from my workout tracker that lived in trusty Google Sheets for the last year. </p>
<p>In a weekend. </p>
<p>Couple of nights. </p>
<p>While figuring out how to use it.</p>
<p>I'm not sure I've felt this much excitement tinkering with a new tool in a while.</p>
<p>I'd seen so many posts about vibe-coding and I had just dismissed them.I'd even tried it but the friction was high, copy/pasting between IDE or jumping through a lot of hoops to set it up. Claude Code was the opposite:</p>
<ul>
<li>Super simple install</li>
<li>Slick terminal based interaction</li>
<li>Nice plugin for vscode, also usable in terminal or through convo style bubble UI</li>
</ul>
<p>So far in 4 days I've created 2 web apps that were spreadsheets <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/carlocarfora/kettletrack">tracking workouts</a>, and I've created a CLI interface for a web-based tool at work. I've hit the token limits every day, and I've looked forward to them resetting every time 😆</p>
<p>It's fun to be able to turn ideas into actual MVP's, although I read a cool article to think less about a <strong>Minimum Viable Product</strong> and more about <strong>Simple, Lovable, Complete</strong> (SLC). I look forward to cooking up more of these, I think keeping scope small and focused is key to having a working &quot;vibe coded&quot; SLC!</p>
<p>Here's <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://longform.asmartbear.com/slc/">the article</a> about SLC if anyone's interested. Happy vibin.</p>
